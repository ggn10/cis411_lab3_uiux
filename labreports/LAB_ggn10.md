# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn.com | 20 | Overall, LinkedIn is very clean website. It offers straightforward access to all critical points it offers. Profile creation was in-depth and easy. The profile creation assistant was pivotal to the creation process. The job search process was simple and all-inclusive. |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1: LinkedIn

![LinkedIn Home](/ggn10Assets/LinkedInHomeSS.PNG)
Home page has all access points to the critical parts of the website.

![LinkedIn Profile](/ggn10Assets/LinkedInProfileSS.PNG)
Profile was very easy to create and offered great recommendations to improve my profile.

![LinkedIn Job](/ggn10Assets/LinkedInJobSS.PNG)
Job description was very in-depth and I really liked how they had a list of all job offerings in the view.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Creating a profile and searching for a job was easily done and greatly assisted |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Gets right to the point; Everything I needed was right there when I first accessed LinkedIn |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | Important steps/info was made very clear through highlights and large bold boxes |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | Only critique I would have here is that there was so much information it was almost hard to process |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Small and accurate descriptions were always given |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Each part of the profile creation and job search built upon itself perfectly |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | Linked offers a great mobile app that is very easily accessible |
| **TOTAL** | 20  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2: Indeed

![Indeed Home](/ggn10Assets/IndeedHomeSS.PNG)
Home page was direct and the first thing you see was a job search box.

![Indeed Profile](/ggn10Assets/IndeedProfileSS.PNG)
Profile was a bit scarce compared to LinkedIn

![Indeed Job](/ggn10Assets/IndeedJobSS.PNG)
Job feed was very useful and I like the short and concise "What" and "Where" search criteria's.
